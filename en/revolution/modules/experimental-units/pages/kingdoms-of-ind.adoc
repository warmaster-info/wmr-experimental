// the exotic spices that are → exotic spices
// the trade routes → trade routes
// Old World → the Old World
South of Cathay and thousands of leagues to the south-east of the Old World are the Kingdoms of Ind. Lying within
a huge peninsula with good ports, the lands are protected by the ocean and high mountains on their northern
borders. Throughout the country are dense, dark forests that are home to many varieties of sometimes dangerous
creatures. Well-developed agricultural systems radiate from the great rivers, sustaining many towns, cities, and a
large population. Additional wealth is generated from jewels mined in the hills and exotic spices grown
in the ferociously hot and occasionally very wet climate. Until now, trade routes for these commodities have led
primarily to Araby and Cathay, but merchants from the Old World – particularly the bolder ones from Marienburg – are
trying to establish a direct connection. Elven travellers of differing types have also long visited Ind’s shores,
ostensibly for trade but some have suggested their true purpose is more sinister.

// turmoil. Only → turmoil, only
The lands have several independent kingdoms, whose Maharajahs jostle continually with one another for power.
Alliances are continually in flux, with peace and a rough balance of power usually emerging after years of turmoil,
only to be followed by another ruler seeking to dominate the peninsula. Their conflicts are made infinitely more
complex by Ind being the _Land of a Thousand Deities_. Across the different regions multiple deities are revered and
they make many interventions in human affairs. Their power, which Old World travellers often conflate wrongly
with their own lands’ magic, is felt deeply by Ind’s peoples. Furthermore, Ind’s society has a rigid class system, with
the lands’ great wealth concentrated amongst the aristocracies of the various kingdoms. The ruling elite channel
much of their wealth into vast displays of opulence, often in the form of palaces and temples for their Deities. The
arts and crafts of Ind are also highly renowned and those with money dress, reside, and travel in extravagant style.
Similarly, Ind’s culinary culture has a great reputation; in the waterside taverns of Marienburg you may hear of
magnificent banquets with strange meats, vegetables, and spices.

// Warriors → warriors
// Deities → deities
The endless squabbling amongst the kingdoms often leads to war. The nobility proceed upon their campaigns in
chariots, for they can afford the finest pairs of the many horses imported from Araby. But some prefer elephants, a
terrifying foe particularly when used in numbers. The less wealthy warriors go on foot, or horseback if they are
tasked with reconnaissance. The rank-and-file carry longbows and swords, having been summoned in great numbers
from their kingdom’s towns and villages. Additionally, Ind armies are well-known for the employment of espionage
and subversion against their enemies’ commanders. The Maharajahs’ forces are accompanied by their Purohitas,
powerful priests who harness the energy of the deities in pursuit of victory. They can also seek direct help from the
deities who, from their world, project battlefield assistance. However, the deities can be fickle, and if the tide of
battle shifts unfavourably they may suddenly withdraw their forces.

[#spells]
== Kingdoms of Ind spells

[#behold-the-avatar]
=== Behold the Avatar

[.cost]#6+ to cast# [.points]#Range N/A#

_Drawing upon their last reserves of magical energy, the Purohita summons a terrifying Avatar and then retires – utterly exhausted – from the battlefield._

This spell can only be cast successfully once per game.

If successful, replace the Purohita with an Avatar. The Purohita counts as lost when calculating [.edit]#victory points# at the end of the game.

[#thousand-eyed-spies]
=== Thousand-Eyed Spies

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 50cm#

_The night before battle the Purohita secretly entered the enemy camp and subverted the dreams of leading officers. Triggered later by his magical words and gaze, they issue contradictory orders to their soldiers._

This spell can only be cast on an unengaged enemy unit visible to the Purohita.

Until the end of their player’s next Command phase, the unit cannot form part of a brigade.

[#tongues-of-fire]
=== Tongues of Fire

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_The Purohita carefully gathers the Devan’s energy before directing it suddenly to wreak havoc amongst their enemies._

This spell can only be cast on an unengaged enemy unit visible to the Purohita.

It is treated like 3 ordinary shooting attacks except that armour has no effect. Target unit can be driven back by the spell.

[#summon-devans]
=== Summon Devans

[.cost]#4+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_As its link to the mortal world, the Purohita appeals to their [.edit]#deity# for reinforcements to smite the foes.__

This spell can be cast on any friendly Devan unit that has lost one or two stands. The Purohita does not need to see the unit.

The unit regains one stand, which is placed in formation with the rest of the unit. If the unit is already in combat the additional stand can be placed so that it touches the enemy and will count as charging if the unit charged.

If it is impossible to position the stand in a formation with its unit, the spell cannot be cast.
