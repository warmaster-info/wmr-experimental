South of Cathay and thousands of leagues to the south-east of the Old World are the Kingdoms of Ind.
Lying within a huge peninsula with good ports, the lands are protected by the ocean and high mountains on their northern borders.
Throughout the country are dense, dark forests that are home to many varieties of sometimes dangerous creatures.
Well-developed agricultural systems radiate from the great rivers, sustaining many towns, cities, and a large population.
Additional wealth is generated from jewels mined in the hills and the exotic spices that are grown in the ferociously hot and occasionally very wet climate.
Until now, the trade routes for these commodities have led primarily to Araby and Cathay, but merchants from Old World – particularly the bolder ones from Marienburg – are trying to establish a direct connection.
Elven travellers of differing types have also long visited Ind’s shores, ostensibly for trade but some have suggested their true purpose is more sinister.

The lands have several independent kingdoms, whose Maharajahs jostle continually with one another for power.
Alliances are continually in flux, with peace and a rough balance of power usually emerging after years of turmoil, only to be followed by another ruler seeking to dominate the peninsula.
Their conflicts are made infinitely more complex by Ind being the _Land of a Thousand Deities_.
Across the different regions multiple deities are revered and they make many interventions in human affairs.
Their power, which Old World travellers often conflate wrongly with their own lands’ magic, is felt deeply by Ind’s peoples.
Furthermore, Ind’s society has a rigid class system, with the lands’ great wealth concentrated amongst the aristocracies of the various kingdoms.
The ruling elite channel much of their wealth into vast displays of opulence, often in the form of palaces and temples for their deities.
The arts and crafts of Ind are also highly renowned and those with money dress, reside, and travel in extravagant style.
Similarly, Ind’s culinary culture has a great reputation; in the waterside taverns of Marienburg you may hear of magnificent banquets with strange meats, vegetables, and spices.

The endless squabbling amongst the kingdoms often leads to war.
The nobility proceed upon their campaigns in chariots, for they can afford the finest pairs of the many horses imported from Araby.
But some prefer elephants, a terrifying foe particularly when used in numbers.
The less wealthy warriors go on foot, or horseback if they are tasked with reconnaissance.
The rank-and-file carry longbows and swords, having been summoned in great numbers from their kingdom’s towns and villages.
Additionally, Ind armies are well-known for the employment of espionage and subversion against their enemies’ commanders.
The Maharajahs’ forces are accompanied by their Purohitas, powerful priests who harness the energy of the deities in pursuit of victory.
They can also seek direct help from the deities who, from their world, project battlefield assistance.
However, the deities can be fickle, and if the tide of battle shifts unfavourably they may suddenly withdraw their forces.

== Special rules

[#army-rules]
=== Army rules

Battling Deities:: As conflict unfolds in the mortal world, the army’s Deity (or even Deities) champion their cause, while others interfere.
At the start of each Ind turn, if the army contains at least one stand of Deity Hosts, Deity Riders or an Avatar, roll a D6.
+
If the result is 5 or 6, at any point during that turn the Ind player may re-roll a single D6.
If a 1 or 2, their opponent may force the re-roll of a single D6.
If 3 or 4, nothing happens.

[#special-special-rules]
=== Special rules

[[deities,†]]1. Deities:: Ignore the −1 Attack penalty in combat for fighting terrifying troops.
+
Orders to Deities brigaded with non-Deity units incur a −1 command penalty.
+
At the start of the player’s own Command phase, before initiative movement, each friendly Deity unit that has lost at least one stand rolls a D6.
If the unit has lost 2 stands and is further away than 20cm from a Deity Avatar or Purohita, subtract 1 from the roll.
+

[cols="^1,6",frame=none,grid=none]
|===
|D6 |Result
h|0–1
|Remove one stand. If the Deity Avatar or a Purohita is with the unit and the last stand is removed, they are also removed.

h|2–3
|The unit becomes confused.

h|4–5
|No effect unless the unit is confused, in which case it ceases to be confused.

h|6
|The unit regains one stand. The regained stand is placed in formation with the rest of the unit. If it is impossible to position the stand in a formation, it cannot be added.
|===

[[forest-creatures,†]]2. Forest Creatures:: Can only be brigaded with other Forest Creatures units and do not suffer the −1 command penalty for being in dense terrain.

[[horsemen,†]]3. Horsemen:: Have a range of 15cm and can shoot from any edge.

[[elephants,†]]4. Elephants:: Cause terror and cannot be brigaded with cavalry or chariots.
+
If an Elephant unit would for any reason become confused, it will stampede instead. Stampeding Elephants cannot be given orders or use initiative. Each unit moves according to a D6 roll made at the start of the Command phase:
+
.Stampeding elephants chart
[cols="^1,6",frame=none,grid=none]
|===
|D6 |Result
h|1-2
|Move the elephant unit towards the nearest enemy unit as far as possible. If they contact an enemy unit they charge; if they contact a friendly unit, they burst through

h|3-4
|Move the elephant unit directly away from the nearest enemy unit as far as possible. If the elephants contact an enemy unit, they charge; if they contact a friendly unit, they burst through.

h|5
|Move the elephant unit towards the nearest friendly unit as far as possible. If the elephant contacts any unit (friendly or enemy), they charge.

h|6
|Move the elephant unit directly away from the nearest friendly unit as far as possible. If the elephant contacts any unit (friendly or enemy), they charge.
|===
+
A stampeding Elephant unit that charges will fight in the Combat phase.
It counts as an enemy unit for the duration of the combat.
+
If the Elephants win a combat round they must pursue if possible and will continue to do so in successive combat rounds.
+
Should their opponents be destroyed, they will not advance but will halt.
+
Their stampede ceases at the end of their player’s next Command phase.

[[deity-flyers,†]]5. Deity Flyers:: Can fly and are based facing the long edge of their stands.

[[deity-avatar,†]]6. Deity Avatar:: Has a −1 Command penalty when issuing order to non-Deity units and is able to cast the _Summon Deities_ spell.
+
The Deity Avatar can join any unit, which then causes terror.
+
There can be only one Deity Avatar in a Kingdoms of Ind army, and they cannot be given magic items.

[[elephant-mount,†]]7. Elephant:: This mount can only be used by the Maharajah and Rajahs.
+
If the Deity Avatar is taken, it counts the same as one elephant mount against the maximum allowed.

[[chariot,†]]8. Chariot:: Cannot be used by the Deity Avatar.
