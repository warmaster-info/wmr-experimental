== Description

== Fighting Withdrawal

A more defensible position has  been identified, and a full disengage ordered. It is a test of metal for a 
commander to prevent a tactical retreat from turning into a complete rout.

=== Attacker’s orders

The enemy flees, take the initiative and cut them down before they can take up a defensive position. Smash through their rearguard and put the enemy to flight.

=== Defender’s orders

Youmust cover your withdrawal as the army falls back to a more defensible position. The roads are narrow so you must hold your groudn until the rest of the army gets clear

=== Preparing for battle

The player who wins the scouting roll will be the attacker in this scenario.

After making the scouting roll and the attacker deploys their scouting units, the attacker places three objectives in the defender’s deployment zone. These objectives cannot be placed within 20 cm of a board edge, or eachother.

Mark out three 10cm long sections of the defending player’s board edge as depicted on the map.

=== Mission special rules

Retreat!

Each turn, a single defending unit can leave the battle from each exit point. 

At the end of each of each battle round, a single defending unit with all of it’s remaining stands within 10cm of an exit point is removed from the board. Any characters attached to a unit that is removed goes with them.

Alternatively, if a character is within 10cm of an exit, they may be removed from the board instead. 

Units and characters that leave the board this way never count as slain, nor do they count towards the defender’s break point.

A unit may not leave the battle if there is an enemy unit within 20cm of them.


=== Winning the battle


WINNING THE BATTLE

At the end of the battle:

•	The defender scores 1 victory point for each 100 points worth of units and characters that successfully left the table.
•	The attacker scores 1 victory point for each 100 points worth of the enemy army that has been slain.
•	Either player also scores 2 points for each objective point they control.
