Before the start of the game, the players must note (in secret) the order
their reserves will arrive, and where they will come from.

When a reserve force enters the battlefield, the leader is first
placed anywhere within 5cm of the battlefield edge.  Then, each 
unit is placed with all stands in contact with the battlefield 
edge and moves up to its ordinary movement distance as if it had
received a successful order.  Place each unit this way one at a time.
Units cannot make a charge move or a supporting charge move this way.

Once the reserve units have been deployed, the player begins their Command Phase.

Units that entered from reserves can receive orders in the following Command Phase,
and are considered to have received a succsesful order from their reserve leader, meaning 
on the turn they enter:

* They can only received orders from the reserve leader
* They receive a -1 Command penalty
* They can only receive two more orders
* They may not make initiative moves
